<h1>Gang of Four Patterns</h1>

This project shows usage of some of the gang of four patterns and has unit tests for each pattern used.


<h2>Patterns used:</h2>

<h3>1. Singleton</h3>

<i>The singleton pattern ensures that only one object of a particular class is ever created. All further references to objects of the singleton class refer to the same underlying instance.</i>

<h3>2. Chain of Responsibility</h3>

<i>The chain of responsibility pattern is used to process varied requests, each of which may be dealt with by a different handler.</i>;

<h3>3. Adapter</h3>

<i>The adapter pattern is used to provide a link between two otherwise incompatible types by wrapping the "adaptee" with a class that supports the interface required by the client.</i>

<h3>4. Strategy</h3>

<i>The strategy pattern is used to create an interchangeable family of algorithms from which the required process is chosen at run-time.</i>

<h3>5. Facade</h3>

<i>The facade pattern is used to define a simplified interface to a more complex subsystem.</i>

<h3>6. Observer</h3>

<i>The observer pattern is used to allow an object to publish changes to its state. Other objects subscribe to be immediately notified of any changes.</i>

<h3>7. Abstract Factory</h3>

<i>Abstract Factory</i>

<h3>8. Builder</h3>

<i>The builder pattern is used to create complex objects with constituent parts that must be created in the same order or using a specific algorithm. An external class controls the construction algorithm.</i>
